# Donors for Charity

## Introduction

>The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

The goal of this is construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.

**We will use many supervised learning algorithms such as:**
- GaussianNB
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods
  - Bagging
  - Adaboost
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- Logistic Regression

**Then, we will be using many metrics:**
- Evaluation Metrics(Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- fbeta score

***We will be using Grid SearchCV to get parameters and values on the model with highest evaluation metrics to improve the model.***

### Packages Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotLib
- scikit-learn
